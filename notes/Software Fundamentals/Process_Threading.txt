[Process]
- Executable
- separate system resources 

[Threading]
- within same process
- shared memory resources in same heap  

# Synchronization / Lock
  - prevent multiple threads access same resource at the same time

# Deadlocks
- both thread waiting lock releases
  - Mutual Exclusion: Only one process can access a resource at given time
  - Hold and Wait: not relinquishing current resources when requesting additional resoures
  - No Preemption: cannot forcibly remove another process' resource
  - Circular Wait: each process is waiting another resource
