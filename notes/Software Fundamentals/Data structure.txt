### Data Structure ###

# Array
- sequece of memory locations

# Linked Lists
- Collection of nodes which each node reference to the next node
- Stack FILO
- Queue FIFO
- Doubly Linked Lists

# Tree
- collection of nodes which connected by edges, root to leaves 
- binary tree
  - each node has 2 children

# Graph
- collection of vertices and edges

# Hash Table
- key, value with unique index
- hashing to generate index
- linked list
- faster look up, find the index instead look up the list one by one
